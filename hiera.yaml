# customer_name     can be used if you have config for multiple customers
# application_name  description for a application, like "mywebsite.com"
# application_role  description of a role to make your application_name running like "webserver" / "database" / "mailserver"

# Some idea's, you can also add the customer_environment so you can set different setttings based on a environment.
# like a hostname that is www.dev.example.com for your dev environment and www.example.com for your production environment
